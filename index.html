                    <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
                    
                    <p>We are tired of the standard template paper, as implicitly or explicitly required by mainstream CS and AI conferences. These venues typically demand a rigid structure: Introduction / Background – Related Work – Method – Theory – Experiments – Discussion – Conclusion. Most reviewers expect substantial benchmarking or theoretical proofs, and if, unfortunately, you and your co-authors fail to meet these expectations, your paper is likely to be rejected. As a result, many brilliant ideas are discarded and never reach the broader community due to minor imperfections or insufficient 'evidence'.</p>

                    <p><strong>We are truly bored of this.</strong></p>

                    <p>Scientific discovery doesn't follow or fit into a standard template. It doesn't need to be all-encompassing. It only needs to be credible, interesting, and tested to a reasonable degree - not molded to satisfy the excessive, often unreasonable, demands of reviewers. Had Newton submitted his early works to today's conferences, it's quite possible they would have been rejected.</p>

                    <p>Science wears many faces, and we appreciate its diversity. Scientific contributions shouldn't be constrained by the superficial formats expected by conference committees. We believe 'make-up' is unnecessary (though this does not mean we don't value rigor or evidence).</p>

                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <h3>That's why we propose this special conference: SPGI – Short Paper, Great Idea.</h3>
                        <p>SPGI: Short Paper, Great Idea
Pronounced as “S-P-G-A” or just “spaghetti”, SPGI is a venue for concise, high-impact contributions. We value clarity, originality, and sharp insight over length or exhaustive coverage. If your idea is great, you don’t need many pages to convince us.</p>
                        <p>We're not looking for full-spectrum performance plots. Instead, we seek 1 or 2 features that shine, e.g. a beautiful theory, a compelling proof, a novel method, a valuable addition to existing methods, a striking empirical insight, a practical application, or simply a brilliant idea. That's enough.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>You don't need to include theoretical proofs, convergence rates, or guarantees, if you're not comfortable with them, if they're not relevant, or if you simply don't have the time. Likewise, if you're not a coding enthusiast, you don't need to implement your theory — synthetic data is welcome, and real-world demonstrations are optional. If you do work on real-world applications, there's no need to wrap them in a theoretical framework, unless you choose to.</p>

                    <p>No one will criticize imperfection, and there is no perfectionism at this conference. We don't require benchmarks. Your work doesn't need to conform to someone else's metrics to be beautiful - they are not universal. We understand how frustrating when a elegant methodology get rejected because it performs marginally less efficient than SOTA methods. That doesn't mean they're not worthwhile. Even lower-performing methods can add value to the methodological landscape. Unfortunately, under current review systems, such contributions are often dismissed at first glance.</p>

                    <p><strong>We therefore advocate for tolerance of imperfection in scientific discovery.</strong></p>

                    <h3>Submission Format</h3>
                    <p>As such, SPGI has no strict submission format—there is no template. As long as your paper is <strong>scientifically sound</strong> and <strong>written with academic clarity</strong>, it <strong>deserves careful consideration</strong>.</p>

                    <h3>Review Process</h3>
                    <p>The review process will be public and open-access on OpenReview. We are also introducing a novel review mode: Review of Reviews (RoR) and post-publication review. In RoR, reviewers not only evaluate the paper but also review each other's reviews, promoting fairness, transparency, objectivity and accountability. This creates a multi-directional dialogue between authors and reviewers, as well as among reviewers themselves. Reviews will continue into the post-publication phase, allowing for additional feedback and giving authors the opportunity to update their work to ensure correctness and clarity as it reaches the broader community.</p>

                    <p>In the review process, we won't ask pointless questions like "Have you compared this to SOTA methods?" or "Have you tested this on benchmark X?". We rely on professionalism and common sense to assess submissions.</p>

                        <h3>Requirements</h3>
                        <p>If there is one requirement, it is the page limit:</p>
                        <p><strong>2-page papers are desirable (not strict though).</strong> We believe two pages are enough to present a great idea. The only expectation is that your submission is human-written. If an AI assistant is used, please declare so.</p>
                        <p>We welcome submissions from all scientific domains.</p>
